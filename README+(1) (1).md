# Melanoma Assignment
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- The basic aim of this project is to build a CNN network using Python to detect Melanoma condition. 
- This Project can be used to solve many problem related to skin cancer.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The project conclusion can give us the skin condition of a disease infected victim.

## Technologies Used
- Google Colab
